* [__Project1: Purchase Prediction Project__](https://github.com/AhmedWageh97/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/01-Purchase%20Prediction "Purchase Prediction Project") : 
  *This project is an application on Classification using Logistic Regression algorithm. We have [dataset](https://github.com/AhmedWageh97/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/01-Purchase%20Prediction/Social_Network_Ads.csv) for people who purchased a specific production. We have ID, Gender(1 for males and 0 for females), Age, Salary and purchase status (1 for purchasing and 0 for not). we need to classify it by Age and salary for __purchased__ and __not purchased__ people and develop our prediction model depend on the given dataset. I used all the set as a __Training Set__ and tested my model by people whose age is not dividabe by 2 as a __Test set__.
  * To test this run [__Purchase.m script__](https://github.com/AhmedWageh97/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/01-Purchase%20Prediction/Purchase.m) on MATLAB or Octave, but make sure that all files in your directory.
  * After that you would show 2 figures: [Figure1]() and [Figure2]().
      * [Figure1 Training set with output classifier:]() shows the result of training set with the classifier which all points above the line most probable to purchase and under the line most probable not to purchase.
      * [Figure2 Test set with output classifier:]() shows the result of test set with the classifier which all points above the line most probable to purchase and under the line most probable not to purchase.
